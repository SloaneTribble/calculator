# calculator

This is the final project for The Odin Project's Foundations section.  It is designed to put our knowledge of JavaScript, CSS and HTML to the test. 

It should be fairly difficult to break this calculator.

Room for improvement: making better use of the object-oriented paradigm.  This project involves some complex decision-making which could be much better organized by assigning various conditions to attributes.

Also, my approach to finding bugs was pretty haphazard, mostly consisting of messing around with the calculator in as many ways as I could conceive.  And oftentimes, fixing one bug created another... 

Altogether this was an excellent beginner's project that took somewhere between 16-24 hours to get to its current state.
